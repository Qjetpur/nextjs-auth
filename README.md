# MongoDB Setup and Configuration

## Introduction
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. This guide provides a step-by-step process to set up and configure MongoDB for your application.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- MongoDB installed (either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

## Installing MongoDB

### Installing MongoDB Locally

1. **Download MongoDB**:
   - Go to the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
   - Select your operating system and download the appropriate version.

2. **Install MongoDB**:
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
     - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the setup wizard.
     - **macOS**: Use `brew` to install MongoDB:
       ```bash
       brew tap mongodb/brew
       brew install mongodb-community
       ```
     - **Linux**: Follow the instructions on the MongoDB website for your specific distribution.

3. **Start MongoDB**:
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath=<path_to_your_data_directory>
     ```
   - **macOS and Linux**: Open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     mongod --dbpath=<path_to_your_data_directory>
     ```

### Using MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)

1. **Create an Account**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create an account.

2. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Follow the instructions to create a new cluster. Choose the free tier for a free cluster.

3. **Configure Network Access**:
   - Add your IP address to the IP Whitelist to allow your local machine to access the database.

4. **Create a Database User**:
   - Create a new database user with a username and password.

5. **Connect to Your Cluster**:
   - Get the connection string from the Atlas dashboard. It will look something like this:
     ```bash
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

## Connecting to MongoDB from Node.js

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Mongoose**:
   Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   
## Deploy on Vercel
